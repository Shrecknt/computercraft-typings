# Computercraft Typings
Typescript type definitions for ComputerCraft / CC: Tweaked

Typings made for use with [typescript to lua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) based on typings from [mat's computercraft miner](https://github.com/mat-1/computercraft-miner)

"I'm not updating that repo anymore
you can make your own computercraft typings repo if you want (but give me credit somewhere)" - [mat](https://github.com/mat-1)

Check the [todo list](todo.txt) to see what still has to be done

There's currently no guide for using the typings, but I'll probably make one later
